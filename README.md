# Strabo - Segmentation and Clustering
Segmentation and Clustering algorithms for positioning locations (GPS etc.)

This project aims at creating a universal segmentation and clustering algorithm that will enable the extended analysis of locations.

## Segmentation
The segmentation algorithm analyzes locations based on latitude, longitude and timestamp and extracts different segments of movement/stop in the given series of locations.
 
## Clustering
The clustering algorithm analyzes locations based only on latitude and longitude in order to locate clusters of locations of any shape.
